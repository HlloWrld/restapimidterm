This application lets you create courses, delete courses, update courses, get list of courses, search courses by ID.
This application is to keep track of school classes for FSWD. You can use postman to test the app.
I had heroku working but it broke half way though I am going through the logs to fix it. 
I showed functionality in my video attached to my assignment. 

I have separated out my models, Routes and calls into different files. 
I did some experimenting with patch and I may have broke it but everything else works perfectly. 

The application logs everything you do into the log.txt file in the application.
The log shows you the action type and the date you are calling it.
